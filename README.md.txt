Implemented a calculator that takes inputs from a user. 
Calculator can add, subtract, multiply, divide, use exponents, and create square roots.
Calculator can also use decimals and parentheses without worry of Big Numbers.
Below, there is a spot where the past ten or less equations are shown with their solutions.
Simply closing the browser or refreshing the page will not change the list of past equations,
although deleting cookies will. I implemented the list by using a queue.
